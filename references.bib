abstract = {Paramagnetic deoxyhemoglobin in venous blood is a naturally occurring contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). By accentuating the effects of this agent through the use of gradient-echo techniques in high fields, we demonstrate in vivo images of brain microvasculature with image contrast reflecting the blood oxygen level. This blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast follows blood oxygen changes induced by anesthetics, by insulin-induced hypoglycemia, and by inhaled gas mixtures that alter metabolic demand or blood flow. The results suggest that BOLD contrast can be used to provide in vivo real-time maps of blood oxygenation in the brain under normal physiological conditions. BOLD contrast adds an additional feature to magnetic resonance imaging and complements other techniques that are attempting to provide positron emission tomography-like measurements related to regional neural activity.},

abstract = {Whole-brain anatomical connectivity in living humans can be modeled as a network with diffusion-MRI and tractography. Network nodes are associated with distinct grey-matter regions, while white-matter fiber bundles serve as interconnecting network links. However, the lack of a gold standard for regional parcellation in brain MRI makes the definition of nodes arbitrary, meaning that network nodes are defined using templates employing either random or anatomical parcellation criteria. Consequently, the number of nodes included in networks studied by different authors has varied considerably, from less than 100 up to more than 104. Here, we systematically and quantitatively assess the behavior, structure and topological attributes of whole-brain anatomical networks over a wide range of nodal scales, a variety of grey-matter parcellations as well as different diffusion-MRI acquisition protocols. We show that simple binary decisions about network organization, such as whether small-worldness or scale-freeness is evident, are unaffected by spatial scale, and that the estimates of various organizational parameters (e.g. small-worldness, clustering, path length, and efficiency) are consistent across different parcellation scales at the same resolution (i.e. the same number of nodes). However, these parameters vary considerably as a function of spatial scale; for example small-worldness exhibited a difference of 95{\%} between the widely-used automated anatomical labeling (AAL) template (??? 100 nodes) and a 4000-node random parcellation (??AAL = 1.9 vs. ??4000 = 53.6 ?? 2.2). These findings indicate that any comparison of network parameters across studies must be made with reference to the spatial scale of the nodal parcellation. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Traditionally, multiple sclerosis (MS) is considered to be a disease primarily affecting the white matter (WM). However, the development of some clinical symptoms such as cognitive impairment cannot be fully explained by the severity of WM pathology alone. During the past decades it became clear that gray matter (GM) damage of the brain is also of major importance in patients with MS. Thanks to improved magnetic resonance imaging techniques, the in vivo detection of GM pathology became possible, enabling a better understanding of the manifestation of various clinical symptoms, such as cognitive impairment. Using higher field strengths and specific sequences, detection of cortical lesions was increased. However, despite these improvements, visualization of cortical MS lesions remains difficult (only about 30-50{\%} of histopathologically confirmed lesions can be detected at 7. Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)). Furthermore, more research is needed to understand the exact interplay of cortical lesions, GM atrophy and WM pathology in the development of clinical symptoms. In this review, we summarize the historical background that preceded current research and provide an overview of the current knowledge on clinical consequences of GM pathology in MS in terms of disability, cognitive impairment and other clinically important signs such as epileptic seizures.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) successfully identified various chromosomal regions to be associated with multiple sclerosis (MS). The primary aim of this study was to replicate reported associations from GWAS using an exome array in a large German study. German MS cases (n = 4,476) and German controls (n = 5,714) were genotyped using the Illumina HumanExome v1-Chip. Genotype calling was performed with the Illumina Genome StudioTM Genotyping Module, followed by zCall. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in seven regions outside the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region showed genome-wide significant associations with MS (P values {\textless} 5 × 10−8). These associations have been reported previously. In addition, SNPs in three previously reported regions outside the HLA region yielded P values {\textless} 10−5. The effect of nine SNPs in the HLA region remained (P {\textless}10−5) after adjustment for other significant SNPs in the HLA region. All of these findings have been reported before or are driven by known risk loci. In summary, findings from previous GWASforMS could be successfully replicated.We conclude that the regions identified in previousGWASare also associated in the German population. This reassures the need for detailed investigations of the functional mechanisms underlying the replicated associations},

Standardized descriptions published in 1996 based on a survey of international MS experts provided purely clinical phenotypes based on data and consensus at that time, but imaging and biological correlates were lacking. Increased understanding of MS and its pathology, coupled with general concern that the original descriptors may not adequately reflect more recently identified clinical aspects of the disease, prompted a re-examination of MS disease phenotypes by the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials of MS. While imaging and biological markers that might provide objective criteria for separating clinical phenotypes are lacking, we propose refined descriptors that include consideration of disease activity (based on clinical relapse rate and imaging findings) and disease progression. Strategies for future research to better define phenotypes are also outlined.},

abstract = {Histopathological and magnetic resonance$\backslash$r$\backslash$nimaging (MRI) studies have shown white matter (WM) damage in early stages of multiple sclerosis (MS) beyond the apparent T2-hyperintense lesions. These changes in normal appearing WM (NAWM) are important with regard to the clinical picture and prognosis. However, the detection of changes within NAWM has so far required special imaging techniques commonly not available in clinical routine and, hence, at large scale. The purpose of this study was to detect MS-related damage of NAWM by conventional MRI. As, within NAWM, the myelin content mainly drives the T1-weighted (T1w) signal, we scaled it by the T2w signal. We tested the hypothesis that the mean T1w/T2w ratio of NAWM is decreased in MS compared to healthy controls (HC) and that it correlates with clinical measures. We developed a pipeline to determine the individual mean values of this ratio within NAWM. We studied 244 patients in early disease stages of MS (mean age 37 ± 10 years, mean disease duration 3.1 ± 2.3, Expanded Disability Status Scale 1.3 ± 1), and 78 HC (mean age 31 ± 8 years). Compared to HC, the mean T1w/T2w ratio was lowered in the patient group (P$\backslash$0.001). The difference remained significant after restricting the analysis to patients with a disease duration of 5 years or less and without disease modifying drugs. Our measures also correlated with clinical scores. We believe that the mean T1w/T2w ratio is a promising candidate to assess MS-related tissue damage within NAWM at large scale.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential of registered volumetric MRI in measuring rates of atrophy in MS. BACKGROUND: Pathologic and imaging studies suggest that the development of permanent neurologic impairment in MS is associated with progressive brain and spinal cord atrophy. Atrophy has been suggested as a potential marker of disease progression. Conventional atrophy measurements requiring manual outlining are time-consuming and subject to reproducibility problems. Registration of serial MRI may offer a useful alternative in that cerebral losses may be measured directly from automated subtraction of brain volumes. METHODS: Twenty-six patients with MS and 26 age- and gender-matched controls had two volumetric brain MR studies 1 year apart. Baseline brain and ventricular volumes were measured using semiautomated techniques, and follow-up scans were registered to baseline. Rates of cerebral atrophy were calculated directly from the registered scans. RESULTS: Baseline brain volumes in the MS group were smaller (mean difference 78 mL [95{\%} CI 13 to 143; p = 0.02]) and ventricular volumes greater (mean difference 12 mL [95{\%} CI 6 to 18; p {\textless} 0.001]) than controls. The rate of cerebral atrophy in the MS group (0.8{\%} per year) was over twice that of controls (0.3{\%}), and the rate of ventricular enlargement was five times greater than the controls (1.6 versus 0.3 mL/year). CONCLUSION: Progressive cerebral atrophy is an important feature of MS. Registration-based measurements are sensitive and reproducible, allowing progressive atrophy to be detected within 1 year and may have potential as a marker of progression in monitoring therapeutic trials.},

abstract = {Purpose: In this work, we introduce a method to classify Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients into four clinical profiles using structural connectivity information. For the first time, we try to solve this question in a fully automated way using a computer-based method. The main goal is to show how the combination of graph-derived metrics with machine learning techniques constitutes a powerful tool for a better characterization and classification of MS clinical profiles. Materials and Methods: Sixty-four MS patients [12 Clinical Isolated Syndrome (CIS), 24 Relapsing Remitting (RR), 24 Secondary Progressive (SP), and 17 Primary Progressive (PP)] along with 26 healthy controls (HC) underwent MR examination. T1 and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were used to obtain structural connectivity matrices for each subject. Global graph metrics, such as density and modularity, were estimated and compared between subjects' groups. These metrics were further used to classify patients using tuned Support Vector Machine (SVM) combined with Radial Basic Function (RBF) kernel. Results: When comparing MS patients to HC subjects, a greater assortativity, transitivity, and characteristic path length as well as a lower global efficiency were found. Using all graph metrics, the best F-Measures (91.8, 91.8, 75.6, and 70.6{\%}) were obtained for binary (HC-CIS, CIS-RR, RR-PP) and multi-class (CIS-RR-SP) classification tasks, respectively. When using only one graph metric, the best F-Measures (83.6, 88.9, and 70.7{\%}) were achieved for modularity with previous binary classification tasks. Conclusion: Based on a simple DTI acquisition associated with structural brain connectivity analysis, this automatic method allowed an accurate classification of different MS patients' clinical profiles.},

abstract = {Axonal degeneration is a major determinant of permanent neurological impairment during multiple sclerosis (MS). Due to the variable course of clinical disease and the heterogeneity of MS lesions, the mechanisms governing axonal degeneration may differ between disease stages. While the etiology of MS remains elusive, there now exist potential prognostic biomarkers that can predict the conversion to clinically definite MS. Specialized imaging techniques identifying axonal injury and drop-out are becoming established in clinical practice as a predictive measure of MS progression, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) or diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). However, these imaging techniques are still being debated as predictive biomarkers since controversy surrounds their lesion-specific association with expanded disability status scale (EDSS). A more promising diagnostic measure of axonal degeneration has been argued for the detection of reduced N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) and Creatine ratios via magnetic resonance spectroscopic (MRS) imaging, but again fail with its specificity for predicting actual axonal degeneration. Greater accuracy of predictive biomarkers is therefore warranted and may include CSF neurofilament light chain (NF-L) and neurofilament heavy chain (NF-H) levels, for progressive MS. Furthermore, defining the molecular mechanisms that occur during the neurodegenerative changes in the various subgroups of MS may in fact prove vital for the future development of efficacious neuroprotective therapies. The clinical translation of a combined Na+ and Ca2+ channel blocker may lead to the establishment of a bona fide neuroprotective agent for the treatment of progressive MS. However, more specific therapeutic targets to limit axonal damage in MS need investigation and may include such integral axonal proteins such as the collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2), a molecule which upon post-translational modification may propagate axonal degeneration in MS. In this review, we discuss the current clinical determinants of axonal damage in MS and consider the cellular and molecular mechanisms that may initiate these neurodegenerative changes. In particular we highlight the therapeutic candidates that may formulate novel therapeutic strategies to limit axonal degeneration and EDSS during progressive MS.},

abstract = {There has been an increasing use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) by the neuroscience community to examine differences in functional connectivity between normal control groups and populations of interest. Understanding the reliability of these functional connections is essential to the study of neurological development and degenerate neuropathological conditions. To date, most research assessing the reliability with which resting-state functional connectivity characterizes the brain's functional networks has been on scans between 3 and 11 min in length. In our present study, we examine the test-retest reliability and similarity of resting-state functional connectivity for scans ranging in length from 3 to 27 min as well as for time series acquired during the same length of time but excluding half the time points via sampling every second image. Our results show that reliability and similarity can be greatly improved by increasing the scan lengths from 5 min up to 13 min, and that both the increase in the number of volumes as well as the increase in the length of time over which these volumes was acquired drove this increase in reliability. This improvement in reliability due to scan length is much greater for scans acquired during the same session. Gains in intersession reliability began to diminish after 9-12 min, while improvements in intrasession reliability plateaued around 12-16 min. Consequently, new techniques that improve reliability across sessions will be important for the interpretation of longitudinal fMRI studies.},

abstract = {We propose a method for the statistical analysis of fMRI data that tests cluster units rather than voxel units for activation. The advantages of this analysis over previous ones are both conceptual and statistical. Recognizing that the fundamental units of interest are the spatially contiguous clusters of voxels that are activated together, we set out to approximate these cluster units from the data by a clustering algorithm especially tailored for fMRI data. Testing the cluster units has a two-fold statistical advantage over testing each voxel separately: the signal to noise ratio within the unit tested is higher, and the number of hypotheses tests compared is smaller. We suggest controlling FDR on clusters, i.e., the proportion of clusters rejected erroneously out of all clusters rejected and explain the meaning of controlling this error rate. We introduce the powerful adaptive procedure to control the FDR on clusters. We apply our cluster-based analysis (CBA) to both an event-related and a block design fMRI vision experiment and demonstrate its increased power over voxel-by-voxel analysis in these examples as well as in simulations.},

@article{Anderson2013,
abstract = {Functional network connectivity (FNC) is a method of analyzing the temporal relationship of anatomical brain components, comparing the synchronicity between patient groups or conditions. We use functional-connectivity measures between independent components to classify between Schizophrenia patients and healthy controls during resting-state. Connectivity is measured using a variety of graph-theoretic connectivity measures such as graph density, average path length, and small-worldness. The Schizophrenia patients showed significantly less clustering (transitivity) among components than healthy controls (p {\textless} 0.05, corrected) with networks less likely to be connected, and also showed lower small-world connectivity than healthy controls. Using only these connectivity measures, an SVM classifier (without parameter tuning) could discriminate between Schizophrenia patients and healthy controls with 65{\%} accuracy, compared to 51{\%} chance. This implies that the global functional connectivity between resting-state networks is altered in Schizophrenia, with networks more likely to be disconnected and behave dissimilarly for diseased patients. We present this research finding as a tutorial using the publicly available COBRE dataset of 146 Schizophrenia patients and healthy controls, provided as part of the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project. We demonstrate preprocessing, using independent component analysis (ICA) to nominate networks, computing graph-theoretic connectivity measures, and finally using these connectivity measures to either classify between patient groups or assess between-group differences using formal hypothesis testing. All necessary code is provided for both running command-line FSL preprocessing, and for computing all statistical measures and SVM classification within R. Collectively, this work presents not just findings of diminished FNC among resting-state networks in Schizophrenia, but also a practical connectivity tutorial.},

abstract = {The white matter (WM) of the brain is damaged in multiple sclerosis (MS), even in areas that appear normal on standard MR imaging. The purpose of our study is to evaluate the damage of normal appearing white matter (NAWM) in patients with MS. In our study, 84 MS patients and 42 healthy adults underwent a routine brain MRI, including also diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). All studies were performed on a 3 T MRI scanner. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were obtained. The DTI parameters of NAWM were correlated with expanded disability status scales (EDSS) scores. Our results showed statistically significant differences in FA and ADC values between MS plaques and the symmetrical NAWM, as also between NAWM and the respective white matter in controls. The ADC values of the NAWM correlated with the EDSS scores. The present study demonstrated damage of the NAWM in MS patients, using DTI in 3.0 T. DTI may be used in the detection of subtle damage of the white matter.},

abstract = {Brain connectivity datasets comprise networks of brain regions connected by anatomical tracts or by functional associations. Complex network analysis-a new multidisciplinary approach to the study of complex systems-aims to characterize these brain networks with a small number of neurobiologically meaningful and easily computable measures. In this article, we discuss construction of brain networks from connectivity data and describe the most commonly used network measures of structural and functional connectivity. We describe measures that variously detect functional integration and segregation, quantify centrality of individual brain regions or pathways, characterize patterns of local anatomical circuitry, and test resilience of networks to insult. We discuss the issues surrounding comparison of structural and functional network connectivity, as well as comparison of networks across subjects. Finally, we describe a Matlab toolbox (http://www.brain-connectivity-toolbox.net) accompanying this article and containing a collection of complex network measures and large-scale neuroanatomical connectivity datasets. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Diez2015,
abstract = {Elucidating the intricate relationship between brain structure and function, both in healthy and pathological conditions, is a key challenge for modern neuroscience. Recent progress in neuroimaging has helped advance our understanding of this important issue, with diffusion images providing information about structural connectivity (SC) and functional magnetic resonance imaging shedding light on resting state functional connectivity (rsFC). Here, we adopt a systems approach, relying on modular hierarchical clustering, to study together SC and rsFC datasets gathered independently from healthy human subjects. Our novel approach allows us to find a common skeleton shared by structure and function from which a new, optimal, brain partition can be extracted. We describe the emerging common structure-function modules (SFMs) in detail and compare them with commonly employed anatomical or functional parcellations. Our results underline the strong correspondence between brain structure and resting-state dynamics as well as the emerging coherent organization of the human brain.},

@article{Richiardi2012,
abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS), a variable and diffuse disease affecting white and gray matter, is known to cause functional connectivity anomalies in patients. However, related studies published to-date are post hoc; our hypothesis was that such alterations could discriminate between patients and healthy controls in a predictive setting, laying the groundwork for imaging-based prognosis. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging resting state data of 22 minimally disabled MS patients and 14 controls, we developed a predictive model of connectivity alterations in MS: a whole-brain connectivity matrix was built for each subject from the slow oscillations ({\textless}0.11 Hz) of region-averaged time series, and a pattern recognition technique was used to learn a discriminant function indicating which particular functional connections are most affected by disease. Classification performance using strict cross-validation yielded a sensitivity of 82{\%} (above chance at p{\textless}0.005) and specificity of 86{\%} (p{\textless}0.01) to distinguish between MS patients and controls. The most discriminative connectivity changes were found in subcortical and temporal regions, and contralateral connections were more discriminative than ipsilateral connections. The pattern of decreased discriminative connections can be summarized post hoc in an index that correlates positively ($\rho$=0.61) with white matter lesion load, possibly indicating functional reorganisation to cope with increasing lesion load. These results are consistent with a subtle but widespread impact of lesions in white matter and in gray matter structures serving as high-level integrative hubs. These findings suggest that predictive models of resting state fMRI can reveal specific anomalies due to MS with high sensitivity and specificity, potentially leading to new non-invasive markers.},
