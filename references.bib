abstract = {Functional network connectivity (FNC) is a method of analyzing the temporal relationship of anatomical brain components, comparing the synchronicity between patient groups or conditions. We use functional-connectivity measures between independent components to classify between Schizophrenia patients and healthy controls during resting-state. Connectivity is measured using a variety of graph-theoretic connectivity measures such as graph density, average path length, and small-worldness. The Schizophrenia patients showed significantly less clustering (transitivity) among components than healthy controls (p {\textless} 0.05, corrected) with networks less likely to be connected, and also showed lower small-world connectivity than healthy controls. Using only these connectivity measures, an SVM classifier (without parameter tuning) could discriminate between Schizophrenia patients and healthy controls with 65{\%} accuracy, compared to 51{\%} chance. This implies that the global functional connectivity between resting-state networks is altered in Schizophrenia, with networks more likely to be disconnected and behave dissimilarly for diseased patients. We present this research finding as a tutorial using the publicly available COBRE dataset of 146 Schizophrenia patients and healthy controls, provided as part of the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project. We demonstrate preprocessing, using independent component analysis (ICA) to nominate networks, computing graph-theoretic connectivity measures, and finally using these connectivity measures to either classify between patient groups or assess between-group differences using formal hypothesis testing. All necessary code is provided for both running command-line FSL preprocessing, and for computing all statistical measures and SVM classification within R. Collectively, this work presents not just findings of diminished FNC among resting-state networks in Schizophrenia, but also a practical connectivity tutorial.},

abstract = {In theatrical productions, there is a process called setting the scene, which is the act of describing a situation so that the audience understands what is happening. Setting the scene lays the groundwork for what to expect during the remaining acts in the production. Similarly, a well-written introduction in a scientific paper sets the scene for the reader. It starts by telling the reader what is happening or has happened (the context), and ends by giving the reader a glimpse of what follows in the remainder of the article (the plot). Introductions seemingly should be easy to write, since they do not require details about methods and results or a discussion of the results. Besides, the introduction is usually found right after the abstract, where you already summarized the content for the reader. In actuality, however, writing a good introduction requires considerable time and thought. Here I provide information about the structure of a good introduction and how to avoid common problems that editors see with submitted manuscripts.},

abstract = {The use of magnetic resonance imaging as a surrogate outcome measure in clinical trials, or even as a prognosticator in the assessment of the natural evolution, assumes a close relationship between extent and rate of development of magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities with the clinical status and rate of development of disability. While it may seem obvious that patients who develop new lesions are worse off than those without new lesions, the association between clinical findings and radiological extent of involvement is generally poor. In this review, various confounders are discussed, including inappropriate clinical rating, lack of histopathological specificity (especially for axonal loss), neglect of spinal cord involvement, underestimation of damage to the normal appearing brain tissue (both white and gray matter), and masking effects of cortical adaptation. It is concluded that much progression has been made in magnetic resonance techniques so that the clinico-radiological dissociation has indeed proved to be a paradox. Thus, the relevance of normal appearing brain tissue damage, residual brain volume, spinal cord damage and cerebral plasticity had to be reiterated. The increased awareness of the subtle interplay between these dimensions should be kept in mind when magnetic resonance is used as a surrogate outcome measure. This corroborates with conventional wisdom that one should not rely on a single magnetic resonance measure, but take full advantage of the fact that magnetic resonance is able to provide multidimensional information.},

abstract = {Histopathological and magnetic resonance$\backslash$r$\backslash$nimaging (MRI) studies have shown white matter (WM) damage in early stages of multiple sclerosis (MS) beyond the apparent T2-hyperintense lesions. These changes in normal appearing WM (NAWM) are important with regard to the clinical picture and prognosis. However, the detection of changes within NAWM has so far required special imaging techniques commonly not available in clinical routine and, hence, at large scale. The purpose of this study was to detect MS-related damage of NAWM by conventional MRI. As, within NAWM, the myelin content mainly drives the T1-weighted (T1w) signal, we scaled it by the T2w signal. We tested the hypothesis that the mean T1w/T2w ratio of NAWM is decreased in MS compared to healthy controls (HC) and that it correlates with clinical measures. We developed a pipeline to determine the individual mean values of this ratio within NAWM. We studied 244 patients in early disease stages of MS (mean age 37 ± 10 years, mean disease duration 3.1 ± 2.3, Expanded Disability Status Scale 1.3 ± 1), and 78 HC (mean age 31 ± 8 years). Compared to HC, the mean T1w/T2w ratio was lowered in the patient group (P$\backslash$0.001). The difference remained significant after restricting the analysis to patients with a disease duration of 5 years or less and without disease modifying drugs. Our measures also correlated with clinical scores. We believe that the mean T1w/T2w ratio is a promising candidate to assess MS-related tissue damage within NAWM at large scale.},

abstract = {We use partial class memberships in soft classification to model uncertain labeling and mixtures of classes. Partial class memberships are not restricted to predictions, but may also occur in reference labels (ground truth, gold standard diagnosis) for training and validation data.Classifier performance is usually expressed as fractions of the confusion matrix, like sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values. We extend this concept to soft classification and discuss the bias and variance properties of the extended performance measures. Ambiguity in reference labels translates to differences between best-case, expected and worst-case performance. We show a second set of measures comparing expected and ideal performance which is closely related to regression performance, namely the root mean squared error RMSE and the mean absolute error MAE.All calculations apply to classical crisp as well as to soft classification (partial class memberships as well as one-class classifiers). The proposed performance measures allow to test classifiers with actual borderline cases. In addition, hardening of e.g. posterior probabilities into class labels is not necessary, avoiding the corresponding information loss and increase in variance.We implemented the proposed performance measures in R package "softclassval" which is available from CRAN and at softclassval.r-forge.r-project.org.Our reasoning as well as the importance of partial memberships for chemometric classification is illustrated by a real-word application: astrocytoma brain tumor tissue grading (80 patients, 37,000 spectra) for finding surgical excision borders. As borderline cases are the actual target of the analytical technique, samples which are diagnosed to be borderline cases must be included in the validation. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {There has been an increasing use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) by the neuroscience community to examine differences in functional connectivity between normal control groups and populations of interest. Understanding the reliability of these functional connections is essential to the study of neurological development and degenerate neuropathological conditions. To date, most research assessing the reliability with which resting-state functional connectivity characterizes the brain's functional networks has been on scans between 3 and 11 min in length. In our present study, we examine the test-retest reliability and similarity of resting-state functional connectivity for scans ranging in length from 3 to 27 min as well as for time series acquired during the same length of time but excluding half the time points via sampling every second image. Our results show that reliability and similarity can be greatly improved by increasing the scan lengths from 5 min up to 13 min, and that both the increase in the number of volumes as well as the increase in the length of time over which these volumes was acquired drove this increase in reliability. This improvement in reliability due to scan length is much greater for scans acquired during the same session. Gains in intersession reliability began to diminish after 9-12 min, while improvements in intrasession reliability plateaued around 12-16 min. Consequently, new techniques that improve reliability across sessions will be important for the interpretation of longitudinal fMRI studies.},

The primary aim of this study was to replicate reported associations from GWAS using an exome array in a large German study. German MS cases (n = 4,476) and German controls (n = 5,714) were genotyped using the Illumina HumanExome v1-Chip. Genotype calling was performed with the Illumina Genome StudioTM Genotyping Module, followed by zCall. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in seven regions outside the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region showed genome-wide significant associations with MS (P values {\textless} 5 × 10−8). These associations have been reported previously. In addition, SNPs in three previously reported regions outside the HLA region yielded P values {\textless} 10−5. The effect of nine SNPs in the HLA region remained (P {\textless}10−5) after adjustment for other significant SNPs in the HLA region. All of these findings have been reported before or are driven by known risk loci. In summary, findings from previous GWASforMS could be successfully replicated.We conclude that the regions identified in previousGWASare also associated in the German population.

Recent progress in neuroimaging has helped advance our understanding of this important issue, with diffusion images providing information about structural connectivity (SC) and functional magnetic resonance imaging shedding light on resting state functional connectivity (rsFC). Here, we adopt a systems approach, relying on modular hierarchical clustering, to study together SC and rsFC datasets gathered independently from healthy human subjects. Our novel approach allows us to find a common skeleton shared by structure and function from which a new, optimal, brain partition can be extracted. We describe the emerging common structure-function modules (SFMs) in detail and compare them with commonly employed anatomical or functional parcellations. Our results underline the strong correspondence between brain structure and resting-state dynamics as well as the emerging coherent organization of the human brain.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential of registered volumetric MRI in measuring rates of atrophy in MS. BACKGROUND: Pathologic and imaging studies suggest that the development of permanent neurologic impairment in MS is associated with progressive brain and spinal cord atrophy. Atrophy has been suggested as a potential marker of disease progression. Conventional atrophy measurements requiring manual outlining are time-consuming and subject to reproducibility problems. Registration of serial MRI may offer a useful alternative in that cerebral losses may be measured directly from automated subtraction of brain volumes. METHODS: Twenty-six patients with MS and 26 age- and gender-matched controls had two volumetric brain MR studies 1 year apart. Baseline brain and ventricular volumes were measured using semiautomated techniques, and follow-up scans were registered to baseline. Rates of cerebral atrophy were calculated directly from the registered scans. RESULTS: Baseline brain volumes in the MS group were smaller (mean difference 78 mL [95{\%} CI 13 to 143; p = 0.02]) and ventricular volumes greater (mean difference 12 mL [95{\%} CI 6 to 18; p {\textless} 0.001]) than controls. The rate of cerebral atrophy in the MS group (0.8{\%} per year) was over twice that of controls (0.3{\%}), and the rate of ventricular enlargement was five times greater than the controls (1.6 versus 0.3 mL/year). CONCLUSION: Progressive cerebral atrophy is an important feature of MS. Registration-based measurements are sensitive and reproducible, allowing progressive atrophy to be detected within 1 year and may have potential as a marker of progression in monitoring therapeutic trials.},

abstract = {The white matter (WM) of the brain is damaged in multiple sclerosis (MS), even in areas that appear normal on standard MR imaging. The purpose of our study is to evaluate the damage of normal appearing white matter (NAWM) in patients with MS. In our study, 84 MS patients and 42 healthy adults underwent a routine brain MRI, including also diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). All studies were performed on a 3 T MRI scanner. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were obtained. The DTI parameters of NAWM were correlated with expanded disability status scales (EDSS) scores. Our results showed statistically significant differences in FA and ADC values between MS plaques and the symmetrical NAWM, as also between NAWM and the respective white matter in controls. The ADC values of the NAWM correlated with the EDSS scores. The present study demonstrated damage of the NAWM in MS patients, using DTI in 3.0 T. DTI may be used in the detection of subtle damage of the white matter.},

abstract = {We propose a method for the statistical analysis of fMRI data that tests cluster units rather than voxel units for activation. The advantages of this analysis over previous ones are both conceptual and statistical. Recognizing that the fundamental units of interest are the spatially contiguous clusters of voxels that are activated together, we set out to approximate these cluster units from the data by a clustering algorithm especially tailored for fMRI data. Testing the cluster units has a two-fold statistical advantage over testing each voxel separately: the signal to noise ratio within the unit tested is higher, and the number of hypotheses tests compared is smaller. We suggest controlling FDR on clusters, i.e., the proportion of clusters rejected erroneously out of all clusters rejected and explain the meaning of controlling this error rate. We introduce the powerful adaptive procedure to control the FDR on clusters. We apply our cluster-based analysis (CBA) to both an event-related and a block design fMRI vision experiment and demonstrate its increased power over voxel-by-voxel analysis in these examples as well as in simulations.},

abstract = {Purpose: In this work, we introduce a method to classify Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients into four clinical profiles using structural connectivity information. For the first time, we try to solve this question in a fully automated way using a computer-based method. The main goal is to show how the combination of graph-derived metrics with machine learning techniques constitutes a powerful tool for a better characterization and classification of MS clinical profiles. Materials and Methods: Sixty-four MS patients [12 Clinical Isolated Syndrome (CIS), 24 Relapsing Remitting (RR), 24 Secondary Progressive (SP), and 17 Primary Progressive (PP)] along with 26 healthy controls (HC) underwent MR examination. T1 and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were used to obtain structural connectivity matrices for each subject. Global graph metrics, such as density and modularity, were estimated and compared between subjects' groups. These metrics were further used to classify patients using tuned Support Vector Machine (SVM) combined with Radial Basic Function (RBF) kernel. Results: When comparing MS patients to HC subjects, a greater assortativity, transitivity, and characteristic path length as well as a lower global efficiency were found. Using all graph metrics, the best F-Measures (91.8, 91.8, 75.6, and 70.6{\%}) were obtained for binary (HC-CIS, CIS-RR, RR-PP) and multi-class (CIS-RR-SP) classification tasks, respectively. When using only one graph metric, the best F-Measures (83.6, 88.9, and 70.7{\%}) were achieved for modularity with previous binary classification tasks. Conclusion: Based on a simple DTI acquisition associated with structural brain connectivity analysis, this automatic method allowed an accurate classification of different MS patients' clinical profiles.},

abstract = {Axonal degeneration is a major determinant of permanent neurological impairment during multiple sclerosis (MS). Due to the variable course of clinical disease and the heterogeneity of MS lesions, the mechanisms governing axonal degeneration may differ between disease stages. While the etiology of MS remains elusive, there now exist potential prognostic biomarkers that can predict the conversion to clinically definite MS. Specialized imaging techniques identifying axonal injury and drop-out are becoming established in clinical practice as a predictive measure of MS progression, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) or diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). However, these imaging techniques are still being debated as predictive biomarkers since controversy surrounds their lesion-specific association with expanded disability status scale (EDSS). A more promising diagnostic measure of axonal degeneration has been argued for the detection of reduced N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) and Creatine ratios via magnetic resonance spectroscopic (MRS) imaging, but again fail with its specificity for predicting actual axonal degeneration. Greater accuracy of predictive biomarkers is therefore warranted and may include CSF neurofilament light chain (NF-L) and neurofilament heavy chain (NF-H) levels, for progressive MS. Furthermore, defining the molecular mechanisms that occur during the neurodegenerative changes in the various subgroups of MS may in fact prove vital for the future development of efficacious neuroprotective therapies. The clinical translation of a combined Na+ and Ca2+ channel blocker may lead to the establishment of a bona fide neuroprotective agent for the treatment of progressive MS. However, more specific therapeutic targets to limit axonal damage in MS need investigation and may include such integral axonal proteins such as the collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2), a molecule which upon post-translational modification may propagate axonal degeneration in MS. In this review, we discuss the current clinical determinants of axonal damage in MS and consider the cellular and molecular mechanisms that may initiate these neurodegenerative changes. In particular we highlight the therapeutic candidates that may formulate novel therapeutic strategies to limit axonal degeneration and EDSS during progressive MS.},

Standardized descriptions published in 1996 based on a survey of international MS experts provided purely clinical phenotypes based on data and consensus at that time, but imaging and biological correlates were lacking. Increased understanding of MS and its pathology, coupled with general concern that the original descriptors may not adequately reflect more recently identified clinical aspects of the disease, prompted a re-examination of MS disease phenotypes by the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials of MS. While imaging and biological markers that might provide objective criteria for separating clinical phenotypes are lacking, we propose refined descriptors that include consideration of disease activity (based on clinical relapse rate and imaging findings) and disease progression. Strategies for future research to better define phenotypes are also outlined.},

Methods of assessing the prognosis for patients who present with a CIS have been sought, because only 30-70{\%} of patients with a CIS develop MS. When clinically silent brain lesions are seen on MRI, the likelihood of developing MS is high. MS can be diagnosed within 3 months of CIS presentation with certain MRI and CSF criteria. Disability from MS is less likely in patients with a CIS of optic neuritis or sensory symptoms only, few or no MRI lesions, a long period to the first relapse, and no disability after the first 5 years. Development of more reliable prognostic markers will enable new treatments to be targeted for those who are most likely to benefit. We encourage continued clinical and laboratory assessment of patients with a CIS.},

The results suggest that BOLD contrast can be used to provide in vivo real-time maps of blood oxygenation in the brain under normal physiological conditions.

abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS), a variable and diffuse disease affecting white and gray matter, is known to cause functional connectivity anomalies in patients. However, related studies published to-date are post hoc; our hypothesis was that such alterations could discriminate between patients and healthy controls in a predictive setting, laying the groundwork for imaging-based prognosis. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging resting state data of 22 minimally disabled MS patients and 14 controls, we developed a predictive model of connectivity alterations in MS: a whole-brain connectivity matrix was built for each subject from the slow oscillations ({\textless}0.11 Hz) of region-averaged time series, and a pattern recognition technique was used to learn a discriminant function indicating which particular functional connections are most affected by disease. Classification performance using strict cross-validation yielded a sensitivity of 82{\%} (above chance at p{\textless}0.005) and specificity of 86{\%} (p{\textless}0.01) to distinguish between MS patients and controls. The most discriminative connectivity changes were found in subcortical and temporal regions, and contralateral connections were more discriminative than ipsilateral connections. The pattern of decreased discriminative connections can be summarized post hoc in an index that correlates positively ($\rho$=0.61) with white matter lesion load, possibly indicating functional reorganisation to cope with increasing lesion load. These results are consistent with a subtle but widespread impact of lesions in white matter and in gray matter structures serving as high-level integrative hubs. These findings suggest that predictive models of resting state fMRI can reveal specific anomalies due to MS with high sensitivity and specificity, potentially leading to new non-invasive markers.},

We describe measures that variously detect functional integration and segregation, quantify centrality of individual brain regions or pathways, characterize patterns of local anatomical circuitry, and test resilience of networks to insult. We discuss the issues surrounding comparison of structural and functional network connectivity, as well as comparison of networks across subjects.

abstract = {This paper presents a systematic analysis of twenty four performance measures used in the complete spectrum of Machine Learning classification tasks, i.e., binary, multi-class, multi-labelled, and hierarchical. For each classification task, the study relates a set of changes in a confusion matrix to specific characteristics of data. Then the analysis concentrates on the type of changes to a confusion matrix that do not change a measure, therefore, preserve a classifier's evaluation (measure invariance). The result is the measure invariance taxonomy with respect to all relevant label distribution changes in a classification problem. This formal analysis is supported by examples of applications where invariance properties of measures lead to a more reliable evaluation of classifiers. Text classification supplements the discussion with several case studies. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Traditionally, multiple sclerosis (MS) is considered to be a disease primarily affecting the white matter (WM). However, the development of some clinical symptoms such as cognitive impairment cannot be fully explained by the severity of WM pathology alone. During the past decades it became clear that gray matter (GM) damage of the brain is also of major importance in patients with MS. Thanks to improved magnetic resonance imaging techniques, the in vivo detection of GM pathology became possible, enabling a better understanding of the manifestation of various clinical symptoms, such as cognitive impairment. Using higher field strengths and specific sequences, detection of cortical lesions was increased. However, despite these improvements, visualization of cortical MS lesions remains difficult (only about 30-50{\%} of histopathologically confirmed lesions can be detected at 7. Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)). Furthermore, more research is needed to understand the exact interplay of cortical lesions, GM atrophy and WM pathology in the development of clinical symptoms. In this review, we summarize the historical background that preceded current research and provide an overview of the current knowledge on clinical consequences of GM pathology in MS in terms of disability, cognitive impairment and other clinically important signs such as epileptic seizures.},

@article{Wu2015,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tobacco use is one of the most common preventable causes of death, but more than half of the Chinese men still use tobacco products. Moreover, 63.6{\%} of Chinese smokers have stated that they would not consider quitting. Specialized and intensive smoking-cessation services are too expensive and passive to have major clinical and public health impacts in developing countries like China. Smoking cessation medications are not covered by medical insurance, and their high price prevents Chinese smokers from using them. Brief interventions are needed to provide cost-effective and timesaving tobacco dependence treatments in China mainland.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS/DESIGN: We describe a two-arm randomized controlled trial for smokers who have no intention to quit. The project will be conducted in outpatient clinics at a large hospital in Beijing, China. Both arms include one face-to-face interview plus five follow-up interventions. Each intervention will last approximately one minute. Subjects allocated to the smoking-reduction intervention arm (SRI) will be advised to reduce smoking consumption to at least half of their current consumption level within the next month. All subjects in the SRI will be warned to bear in mind that an attempt to reduce smoking is an intermediate step before complete cessation. Smokers who have successfully reduced their smoking consumption will be encouraged to completely cease smoking. Controls are subjects allocated to the exercise- and diet-advice arm (EDA) and will be given advice about healthy diet and physical activity, but the advice will not include smoking cessation or reduction. Data collection will be done at baseline and at each follow-up interview using standardized questionnaires. The primary outcomes include self-reported and biochemically verified 7-day point prevalence and prolonged abstinence rates at 12-month follow-up.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDISCUSSION: We expect that an intention to quit in smoking outpatients can be motivated by physicians in the clinic setting. If this very brief smoking-reduction intervention can be demonstrated to have a positive impact on long-term smoking cessation, this strategy has the potential to be a viable and acceptable approach and may be used widely in China and elsewhere.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02370147 (date of registration: 23th February, 2015).},

@article{Zalesky2010,
abstract = {Whole-brain anatomical connectivity in living humans can be modeled as a network with diffusion-MRI and tractography. Network nodes are associated with distinct grey-matter regions, while white-matter fiber bundles serve as interconnecting network links. However, the lack of a gold standard for regional parcellation in brain MRI makes the definition of nodes arbitrary, meaning that network nodes are defined using templates employing either random or anatomical parcellation criteria. Consequently, the number of nodes included in networks studied by different authors has varied considerably, from less than 100 up to more than 104. Here, we systematically and quantitatively assess the behavior, structure and topological attributes of whole-brain anatomical networks over a wide range of nodal scales, a variety of grey-matter parcellations as well as different diffusion-MRI acquisition protocols. We show that simple binary decisions about network organization, such as whether small-worldness or scale-freeness is evident, are unaffected by spatial scale, and that the estimates of various organizational parameters (e.g. small-worldness, clustering, path length, and efficiency) are consistent across different parcellation scales at the same resolution (i.e. the same number of nodes). However, these parameters vary considerably as a function of spatial scale; for example small-worldness exhibited a difference of 95{\%} between the widely-used automated anatomical labeling (AAL) template (??? 100 nodes) and a 4000-node random parcellation (??AAL = 1.9 vs. ??4000 = 53.6 ?? 2.2). These findings indicate that any comparison of network parameters across studies must be made with reference to the spatial scale of the nodal parcellation. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Prospective studies of diagnostic test accuracy have important advantages over retrospective designs. Yet, when the disease being detected by the diagnostic test(s) has a low prevalence rate, a prospective design can require an enormous sample of patients. We consider two strategies to reduce the costs of prospective studies of binary diagnostic tests: stratification and two-phase sampling. Utilizing neither, one, or both of these strategies provides us with four study design options: (1) the conventional design involving a simple random sample (SRS) of patients from the clinical population; (2) a stratified design where patients from higher-prevalence subpopulations are more heavily sampled; (3) a simple two-phase design using a SRS in the first phase and selection for the second phase based on the test results from the first; and (4) a two-phase design with stratification in the first phase. We describe estimators for sensitivity and specificity and their variances for each design, along with sample size estimation. We offer some recommendations for choosing among the various designs. We illustrate the study designs with two examples.},
